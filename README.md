- This video is where we learned how to code important pieces of the game, along with understanding how 2D code vs the 3D code we've normally been working with; how the path of a Tower Defense game works in 2D; and where we could get more information about design aspects. Although we didn't use everything in the video and had to make connections with things that were not explained properly, this video was a cornerstone in teaching us what we needed to know about the style of game we wanted to create.<br>
