## Summary of Activities
- We finished up the code for linking the game over screen if too many shrooms (3 for level one) pass the finish line.
- We completed the drag code and figured out what went wrong previously; it now works!
- Added hearts so the Player is aware of how mnay lives they have left.
- We determined for Level 2: Blue Shrooms will be faster, but kep the same health as the green shroom;
player will have two weapons to chose from: a slingshot and bow and arrow. Two hearts 
- For Level 3, the Red Shrooms: they will be slower, but harder to kill; player has the ability to chose from three weapons:
slingshot, bow and arrow, and gauntling gun.

## Project Retrospective
 - Made sure we were all on the same page with the updated projects; checked each other's work to make
  sure everything worked they way we wanted it to.
### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations: 
      - We managed to figure out the majority of Level 1!
2. Successes: 
      - We cleared up the majority of merging issues!
      - Also added in the last few bits of code to get Level 1 working the way we wanted it too.
      - Figured out what changes would be made to Levels 2 and 3 based off our design document and previous conversation.
3. Failures: 
      - No failures!
4. Barriers:
      - The main barrier now is completing Levels 2 and 3, which should not be as difficult as figuring Level 1.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
     - We have a meeting scheduled Friday Dec. 1st, so we'll determine how the presentation will go.

## Next Steps
- Meet up on Friday to plan out the Final Presentation.
- Finish up levels 2 and 3.
