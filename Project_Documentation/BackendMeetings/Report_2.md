## Summary of Activities
- We shared how far we've gotten with our pieces of the code.
- Determined the we as a backend group should be done with all game code by the November 21st; that should also be the day we make
     sure all our code works on each others computer.
- However, we will each starting working on the individual levels by November 14th.
- Eddie also wants the README and Citatations for the video done by November 14th.
  
## Project Retrospective
 - This meeting was more of a check-in, see where everyone was at and how re-figure how much work there was still left to do.
### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations: 
      - Everyone for our little Backend group showed up!
      - All of us had managed to get some headway; Sami finished her section; Meaghan is working on the enemy creation,
        and Eddie has been working with the weapons.
2. Successes: 
      - We are almost doen with this weeks code, and should be completely done by Thursday.
3. Failures: 
      - None so far!
4. Barriers:
      - The main barrier right now is that we have to work on the code indiviudally first before splicing it all together;
          but we're aware of that drawback and have a plan for it.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
      - We decided, since we're the group that currently meets the most, that if frontend current come to Thurday's upcoming meeting,
           we wouldn't meet until next Tuesday, seeing as we already know what are next phase is.

## Next Steps
- Continue working on our pieces of the code; 
- Update the README and Citation section of github;
- Start thinking about how to code our individual levels.
