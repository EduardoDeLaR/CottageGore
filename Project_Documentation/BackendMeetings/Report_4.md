## Summary of Activities
- We compared each other's code and systems;
- Worked on the Drag script;
- Studied and tried to fix the layering issue with Unity;
- Worked on an updated weapons and shop script;
- Created and tried to implement a loading scene script;
  
## Project Retrospective
 - Today was very much a compare and contrast and see what we need to fix day. Although we knew merging our individual
levels scripts would be a problem, we didn't forsee merging the frontend design with the backend code to be as big of a problem as it became.
### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations: 
      - We all pulled together and did our best to fix the issues;
2. Successes: 
      - We made some progress in determining what problems were linked to which issue, and ideas on how to resolve them.
3. Failures: 
      - No real failures; we didn't realize how difficult it would be to merge, but that's just learning.
4. Barriers:
      - The main barrier is still merging everything, but now we now how much effort it will actually take.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
     - We've scheulded meetings in the future for us all to work on the game together, and will schedule more if the ones we have do not suffice.

## Next Steps
- Continue working on the little pieces of code we were attempting to fix today, while simultaneously making sure that the parts for our levels and inputted.
