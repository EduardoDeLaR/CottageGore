## Summary of Activities
- We shared how far we've gotten with our pieces of the code.
- We determiend who was working on which level of the game.
- We edited the README file and created a pull request for citations.
  
## Project Retrospective
 - This meeting was more of a check-in, see where everyone was at and how re-figure how much work there was still left to do.
### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations: 
      - Everyone for our little Backend group showed up!
      - We all know what needs to be done.
2. Successes: 
      - We completed the code we were working on, and have started on our next section.
3. Failures: 
      - None so far!
4. Barriers:
      - The main barrier is still that we have to work on the code indiviudally first before splicing it all together.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
     - We've decided to cut our meeting times shorter, from an hour to a half-hour, ebcause we're mostly just
   checking in and giving face-to-face updates on our progress.

## Next Steps
- Continue working on our game level in Unity;
