# Report 1
Group 4: CottageGore<br>
Date and location: 10/26/2023, Engineering BLDG, Study Space<br>
Present participants: Samantha Jurado; Eduardo De La Rosa; Meaghan Freund; Caroline Fye; 
Missing participants:Elleana Negrelli<br>
Project repo: CottageGore (https://github.com/sljur/CottageGore)<br>

## Summary of Activities
- We determiend how we wanted to split up the group. One mini-group of for out design and aesthtic aspetics of the game, and another for the backend coding part of the game.
- Sami Jurado, Eduardo De La Rosa, and Meaghan Freund were placed ont he backend team; Caroline Fye and Elleana Negrelli were placed on the frontend team.
- Discussed how we will have main group meeting every Thursday after class, and that backend group will meet every tuesday after class; frontend has yet to determine their meeting times, but are working on it.
- Figured out that the path of our game needs work, so will work on the coding aspects and the aestetic aspects of that piece first.
## Project Retrospective
-Mostly just went over what we knew we wanted versus what we know we need to do.

### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations: 
     -Everyone present agreed on how to split up the game work; we created two groups without much fuss.
2. Successes: 
     -We already had a good game idea before this point, and an almost finished Final Design Document that we could do more coding research on.
3. Failures:
     -No failures so far.
4. Barriers:
     - Determining how we're going to manage to share code work is something we need to figure out.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
     - Nothing to try yet; 
     
## Next Steps
- Finish coding the path for the game; do more research if needed
- Finish drawing aspect fo the game path
