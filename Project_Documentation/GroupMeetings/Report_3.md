# Report 3
Group 2: CottageGore<br>
Date and location: 11/09/2023, Engineering BLDG, Study Space<br>
Present participants: Samantha Jurado; Eduardo De La Rosa; Meaghan Freund; Caroline Fye; Elleana Negrelli <br>
Missing participants: None<br>
Project repo: CottageGore (https://github.com/sljur/CottageGore)<br>

## Summary of Activities
- We finished up the basic code for Spawning, Enemy Creation, and Weapons.
- Caroline and Elleana looked at the Unity animations to see which fits the aesthetics of our game.
- We went over the weapons, how we wanted them staioned( the fairy person+bow and arrow along the road, same with the slingshot), but the slime would be placed inside the road, to slow down the shrooms.
- Compared due dates to make sure both front end and backend were on the same page. Both groups aim to have all code completed by November 21st, that way we can start merging everything together and making sure all levels conform together.
- Re-stated we wanted the README file and Citations done by Nov 14th.

## Project Retrospective
- We checked in with each other, made sure both groups understood where the code and designs were at; cleared up some miscomspections.
### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations:
     - All of us we able to be present for today's meeting!
     - Eddie, Sami and Meaghan are done or mostly done with their portions of code;
     - Elleana and Caroline are starting with the splash screens; figureing out the exact design layout; and animations for the game.   
2. Successes: 
    - We're on track with our timeline for when we want the game done, for both frontend and backend.
    - We're all on the same page with how we wanted things to be completed, and there hasn't been much deviation from when we first conceptualized the idea.
3. Failures:
    - No failures to report!
4. Barriers:
    - We'll still need to meet up to make sure all the code meshes well together, but we're aware of that flaw.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
    - Nothing comes to mind; we re-confirmed our meeting for next week, so all is well.
     
## Next Steps
- Continue working on and editing our sequnces of code;
- Start working on individual levels once current code is uploaded into github
- Start working on splash screens and animations
