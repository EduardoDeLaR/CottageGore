Group 2: CottageGore<br>
Date and location: 11/16/2023, Engineering BLDG, RM101<br>
Present participants: Samantha Jurado; Eduardo De La Rosa; Meaghan Freund; Elleana Negrelli; <br>
Missing participants:Caroline Fye;<br>
Project repo: CottageGore (https://github.com/sljur/CottageGore)<br>

## Summary of Activities
 - We discussed the specifics of the levels and weapon locations.
 - Determined what to do with the lack of a slingshot asset in the unity store; Ellena mentioned she could create one for us to import.
 - Discussed a bit more about logistics of puting the levels together after creation.

## Project Retrospective
 - We mostly checked in with each other and clarified certain aspects of our code that we ran into.
### Activity Check list
1. Appreciations:
     - Eddie reminding us that we need to be able to change the color fo the mushrooms, otherwise we couldn't indicate an eviler mushroom.
     - Meaghan explained how she could upload what she did with her code as a package to give us a starting point for merging everything together.
     - Caroline mentioned prior to meeting that she would begin work on designing the path.
     - Elleana will create the slingshot and importn tham into Unity for us to use.
     - Sami will continue working on Level 1 and writing up the Reports.
2. Successes: 
    - We have kept up a good level of communication and problems are resolved rather quickly with solutions most everyone agrees on.
3. Failures:
    - No failures to report!
4. Barriers:
    - We will continue to meet up to make sure all the code meshes well together once we have everything written, but we're aware of that flaw.
5. Things to Try Next Time:
    - Nothing comes to mind; we re-confirmed our meeting for next week, so all is well.
     
## Next Steps
- Continue working on individual levels and then uploaded them as a package github
- Start looking at how to mesh everything together.
